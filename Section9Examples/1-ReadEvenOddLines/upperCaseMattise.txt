HENRI Ã‰MILE BENOÃ®T MATISSE (31 DECEMBER 1869 Â€“ 3 NOVEMBER 1954) WAS A FRENCH ARTIST, KNOWN FOR BOTH HIS USE OF COLOUR
AND HIS FLUID AND ORIGINAL DRAUGHTSMANSHIP. HE WAS A DRAUGHTSMAN, PRINTMAKER, AND SCULPTOR, BUT IS KNOWN PRIMARILY AS A PAINTER.
MATISSE IS COMMONLY REGARDED, ALONG WITH PABLO PICASSO, AS ONE OF THE ARTISTS WHO BEST HELPED TO DEFINE THE REVOLUTIONARY
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE VISUAL ARTS THROUGHOUT THE OPENING DECADES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY,
RESPONSIBLE FOR SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS IN PAINTING AND SCULPTURE.
